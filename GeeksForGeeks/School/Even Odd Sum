#Even Odd Sum

Given an array Arr[] of N integers.
Find the sum of values of even and odd index positions separately.

Example 1:

Input:
N=5
Arr={1,2,3,4,5}
Output:
9 6
Explanation:
The sum of elements at odd places i.eat 1st,3rd and 5th places are (1+3+5=9)
Similarly,the sum of elements at even places i.e. at 2nd and 4th places are (2+4=6).

Solution Explanation

We need to find the sum of values whose places are even and odd seperately.

Arr={1,5,7,9,2} = {1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th}

Here, 1st, 3rd and 5th are odd places
      2nd and 4th are even places.
      
Index 0 is in 1st place which means it will be added to oddsum.
Index 1 is in 2nd place which means it will be added to evensum.
Index 2 is in 3rd place which means it will be added to oddsum.
....
etc.

So, we can know the index is in odd place or in even place by using this simple calculation

if(Index%2 == 0)
  //Odd place
else
  //even place
  
Index starts from 0 but place value start from 1.
So, 0 index is divisble by 2 which is 1st place actually so it means it will be added to oddsum.
    1 index is not divisible by 2 which is 2nd place actually so it means it will be added to evensum.
